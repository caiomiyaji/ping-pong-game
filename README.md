# Ping-pong game

![preview](./preview.png)

> This is my first attempt on creating a web game! This Ping-pong game was built with HTML CSS and JS. The game was created using the HTML canvas tag. I used class syntax to create all the functionalities and animations. In this game your adversary is a bot, and there's no points limits.
